							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My name is Roman Zhurakhov, I'm 18 years old and Ukraine is my home country. To start out my journey with computers and programming I was learning some IT in my Ukrainian middle school. From grades 5-9 we had IT course on where we learned different tools and languages like Scratch, HTML, Python, Java, and C++. I came to Canada 4 years ago, and finished NNEC high school here and also I took a 1 year Java course to refresh my mind and learn something new. Right now I study for game programmer in NSCC, and it's so much fun to actually develope games, I met many very cool people, eather it's faculty, students, or people from game dev industry here, and I hope to increase this cirlce of friends.</p>
							<p>My life goal is to become a great game developer, make some awesome titles, and most importantly to find good company/friends to work on games together, because it's always better to be in a team enviroment with friendly atmosphere.</p>
